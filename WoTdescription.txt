World of Tanks (WoT) is a massively multiplayer online game developed by
Belarusian company Wargaming, featuring 20th century (1910sâ€“1970s) era combat
vehicles. It is built upon a freemium business model where the game is
free-to-play, but participants also have the option of paying a fee for use of
"premium" features. The focus is on player vs. player gameplay with each player
controlling an armored vehicle, from the time of Pre-World War 2, to the Cold War-era.


Clan Wars
Clan Wars in World of Tanks has two main components: Strongholds and the Global Map. Each clan can have its own stronghold, if the clan's commander wishes to construct one. Each stronghold begins with one zone and can grow to up to four zones as the clan's membership increases. Many different types of structures exist; however, only one of each can be built. By consuming industrial resources, some structures generate special missions or reserves that can be used to temporarily boost clan members' experience or credits, or enable artillery or airstrikes during a battle for a stronghold. To build structures, industrial resources are required, which can be won by attacking another stronghold or through skirmishes.

The Global Map is a collection of fronts on a map based on the real world. There are three fronts, one each for tiers 6, 8, and 10. Each front has provinces that generate gold for the clan that currently owns it. A clan may enter the global map by entering a tournament for a specific province, in which they compete against other clans and ultimately the current landowner.
