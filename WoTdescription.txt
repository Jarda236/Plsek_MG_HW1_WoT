World of Tanks (WoT) is a massively multiplayer online game developed by
Belarusian company Wargaming, featuring 20th century (1910sâ€“1970s) era combat
vehicles. It is built upon a freemium business model where the game is
free-to-play, but participants also have the option of paying a fee for use of
"premium" features. The focus is on player vs. player gameplay with each player
controlling an armored vehicle, from the time of Pre-World War 2, to the Cold War-era.
